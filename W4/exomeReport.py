This report is in response to Dr. Banners request and was prepared by Aldo A. Amaya. 


From the clinical data provided we have identified 7 species that have been both been sequenced and have
a diameter of 20-30 mm diameter. This information is show on Table 1. 

After filtering the top motifs for each of these species we discovered that they all had 3 top motifs: CTTCAAAATTTT, TACACTTCTACA, TTTTTACACTTC. 
They ranged between 50-90 occurences of each motif in species total genes. These results can be seen on Table 2. 

On table 3, we have a list of each species and their unique genes that were filtered by top motifs and had a 23 bp that ended with NGG (21 bp were upstream) for potential Crispr insert.
Number of unique genes were as follow: lamb (13), gorilla(18), gopher(12), goat(12), fox(10), dromedary(18), chicken(10). A list of these can be found on Table 3.  

On Table 4. we looked at shared genes. The most common shared gene within this group was between lamb-gorilla-gopher-chicken and was identified as >gene153. 
Other highly shared genes were >gene307 (goat-dromedary-chicken), >gene404(goat-dromedary-gorillat), and >gene234 (goat-dromedary-fox). 
It is interesting to note the high number of shared genes between the goat-dromedary-4 genes (>gene307,>gene234,>gene404,>gene416) and the gorilla-gopher-4 genes (>gene153,>gene114,>gene286,>gene347).
